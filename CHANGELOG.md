# Changelog

## [2.40](https://github.com/CadiLillian/eFootball-FPS-Limit-and-VSync-Patcher/releases/tag/2.40) (2025-06-18)

## Major Improvements
- Executable Analysis Features Rewritten:  
All Executable Analysis features have been rewritten from the ground up - again - delivering the performance improvements referenced in last version’s [release notes](https://github.com/CadiLillian/eFootball-FPS-Limit-and-VSync-Patcher/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#230-2024-12-25), this time supported by extensive testing to ensure performance and reliability.<br><br>In addition to **significantly faster load times**, this update addresses a long-standing issue:   
Without offline or online optimization, previous versions of the executable analysis features could result in a seemingly endless executable analysis once the patcher is launched.  
This was especially common with the MS Store eFootball versions, as optimization requires someone to dump and share the executable file ([here](https://evoweb.uk/threads/95503/)).

- Patching Support for **all eFootball versions** (Steam and MS Store)!  
Provided KONAMI does not change the way the FPS Limit is handled in eFootball, this will apply to all future eFootball versions.

## Features
- Added Patching Support for all MS Store eFootball Versions!<br><br>
- Added Offline Optimization for Steam eFootball Version 4.5.0
- Added Offline Optimization for Steam and MS Store eFootball Version 4.4.0
- Added Offline Optimization for Steam eFootball Version 4.3.0
- Added Offline Optimization for Steam and MS Store eFootball Version 4.2.1
